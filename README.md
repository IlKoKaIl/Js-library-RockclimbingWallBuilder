# js-library-kokamihi
This is a Js library made to recreate rockclimbing walls in a browser. Developers can use it to create walls that users can interect with. This can be done to either set route as practice or display the beta for a certain route or just to recreate a route climbed by another climber for example in competeition climbing.


Getting stated:
You will need jquery for this library to work, I've included download links in the library code aswell as the documentation page.
Then you will need include CSS and JS files of plugin Which are included in the zip file in the repo

wallClimbify.css
WallClimbify.js

both of which I've added in the zipped package (wallclimbify-packaged.zip), along with run-wallclimbify.js which 
provides some examples for developers to use. But the only two required files are the two listed above.

Documentation can be found in pub/documentaion/index.html in the repo
or you can open the heroku page and there is a link to the documentation there aswell

To run the landing page and the rest of the content in this repo.
After cloning/pulling all the files from the repo. Open terminal and cd till you are in the js-library-kokamihi folder. Once here run node server.js
it Will then run the application at localhost:3000 where you can view it.
Or you can use the heroku deployed app here https://stormy-sands-39576.herokuapp.com/
